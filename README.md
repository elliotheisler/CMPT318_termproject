# Term Project for CMPT 318
### [(View final report here)](pdfs/out/results.pdf)
Source code for a term project I completed for CMPT 318 - Data Analytics at the University of Saskatchewan. It is a basic data analysis pipeline that uses sentiment analysis and an SVM to predict user recommendation from user reviews on Steam games.
### Libraries used:
- PyTorch, scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and Huggingface's API for a pre-trained sentiment analysis classifier.
