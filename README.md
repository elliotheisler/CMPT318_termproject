# Term Project for CMPT 318
### [(View final report here)](pdfs/out/results.pdf)
Source code for a term project I completed for CMPT 318 - Data Analytics at the University of Saskatchewan. It is a basic supervised-learning data pipeline for classifying steam reviews to predict if the user would recommend the game in question. The code is more ad-hoc compared to what I would usually produce, but this is ok since maintainability is
not the main concern when doing data analysis.
### Libraries used:
- PyTorch, scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and Huggingface's API for a pre-trained sentiment analysis classifier.
